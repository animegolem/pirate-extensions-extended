Very broadly in REW; 

1. Take a long moving mic measurement of a single speaker with good directivity. 
2. Very strictly EQ the speaker to flat. This is best done with auto EQ . You will likely need to raise Max Gain and Max Slope quite substantially, on the order of 75/35. 
3. Enable the generator in REW and calibrate the capsule mic using an external SPL meter.
