It's important to understand going in that In-Ear Mics are finnicky and complicated. While the shape of the pirate earplugs is designed to minimize variation you will almost certainly find some EQ is still required by ear. Additionally blocked canal mics will not pick up any canal effects and you should expect notable variation from 2-3k. 

Some familiarity with basic audio science concepts is likely required to use these mics and is well beyond the scope of this guide. Read the original papers and proceed with caution. 

The basic steps required are as follows; 

1. Create a compensation file for the electret capsule. 
2. Measure a flat speaker with the microphone inside the ear.
3. Blend the measured result with the ISO DF around 2k. This can be downloaded from [squiglink](https://squig.animatedmusic.net/). 
4. Measure headphones with compensation file in place. Your results will only be comparable to other measurements taken in your ear, with the same cal file, with the same microphone.
