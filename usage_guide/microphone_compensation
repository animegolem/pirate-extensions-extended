Very broadly in REW; 

1. Measure single speaker with a long moving mic measurement using the measurement mic.
2. Repeat using the capsule. Match position as closely as possible. 
3. Select each measurement alone and take an RMS avg. the resulting measurement will get the prefix magn to show it's magnitude only. 
4. select arithmetic and divide Uncalibrated Mic/Calibrated Mic. consider adjusting the boundaries based on speaker roll off. 
5. Save with a 20,20k cut off and 1/6th or so smoothing.
