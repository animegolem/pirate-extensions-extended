Adapting AudioGroupCologne's Adaptions to the PIRATE In-Ear Microphones for general headphone hobbyist use. Currently a second mold has been created to fit a 3mm or 4mm Electret Capsule. 

## Description
This repository contains additional supplementary materials for adapted in-ear microphones [1], based on the PIRATE microphones design by Denk et al. [2]

I strongly recommend reading both linked papers because this is just boiling down and stealing that work. o7

You can find both the original pirate-extensions files as well as the new files for a 3mm or 4mm electret under [pirate-models](pirate-models). Note that only the top mold has been updated and the original center and base mold are still required.

A detailed guide on how to build the pirate-extension can be found [here](build_guide.md)

For a rough guide on how to use the microphones and create a personal target please see the [usage guide](usage_guide/usage_guide.md). Please expect the results to be confusing and problematic if you start this project. 

I've also setup a [graphtool](https://animegolem.github.io/) as an example of how this data may look once collected. This data should not be compared to any other rig and extreme caution should be used when drawing any conclusions.
