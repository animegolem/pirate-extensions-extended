Adapting AudioGroupCologne's Adaptions to the PIRATE In-Ear Microphones for electret micorphones and general headphone hobbyist use.

## Description
This repository contains additional supplementary materials for adapted in-ear microphones [1], based on the PIRATE microphones design by Denk et al. [2]

I strongly recommend reading both linked papers because this is just boiling down and stealing that work. o7

The updated molds and guide tool support 3mm and 4mm electret capsules. Additionally, the original pirate extensions support a 3mm MEMS microphone. Note that only the top mold has been updated and the original center and base mold are still required.

For a rough guide on how to use the microphones and create a personal target please see the [usage guide](usage_guide/usage_guide.md). Please expect the results to be confusing and problematic if you start this project. 

I've also setup a [graphtool](https://animegolem.github.io/) as an example of how this data may look once collected. This data should not be compared to any other rig and extreme caution should be used when drawing any conclusions.
