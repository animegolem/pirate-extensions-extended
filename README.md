Adapting AudioGroupCologne's Adaptions to the PIRATE In-Ear Microphones for general headphone hobbyist use. Currently a second mold has been created to fit a 3mm Electret Capsule. 

## Description
This repository contains additional supplementary materials for adapted in-ear microphones [1], based on the PIRATE microphones design by Denk et al. [2]

We strongly recommend reading both linked papers because this is just boiling down and stealing that work. o7
