# Ear Plugs

1. Print the universal base, middle, and appropriate top mold based on the capsule you have chosen to use. Any filament should work but petg or nylon will be less likely to snap when demolding. Using a .08mm or smaller layer height may help if you have issues printing the pegs. 
2. Using a 2-Part kneadble silicone combine enough material to fill the mold. In our experience roughly 7 grams of each reagent is more than sufficent. Ensure mold is filled as tightly as possible. 
3. Carefully demold. You may have to trim excess with a razor.
4. Using a needle or similar make a hole from top to bottom on the plug above and below the electret. The top hole is a vent to release pressure and should be unobstructed. The bottom hole should be filled with superglue and a piece of 4mm monofilament. Cut this at a length you can saftely pull from the ear without yanking on the microphone leads. Generally 1-2cm should be sufficient.
5. Using something flat like a (insert size here) allen key push out a hole below the microphone standoff. This will be sealed during use but allow you to easily push out and remove the capsule without pulling the leads.
