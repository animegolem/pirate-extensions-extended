## Bill of Materials 

### Ear Plugs 

1. A reasonably competent 3D printer is required in order to create the mold. Alternatively you could use a print service. 

2. A two part, kneadable silicone. This should be between shore 40-65a so it is soft enough to form a perfect seal but firm enough that it will not deform and vary placement. The original paper suggests 55A is ideal if possible.

* [I've successfully used the following (40a) but harder would be more ideal.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TGKS4KY)

* [Needs to be tested but likely better. (50a)](https://micromark.com/products/micro-mark-rtv-silicone-mold-putty-50-hard)

3. Monofilament fishing line, .4mm or greater.

4. Super Glue

5. A needle or similar to make holes in the finished plug

6. Straight razor to clean up demolded plug. 
 
### Microphone

1. 3-10ft Well shielded Microphone cable (I've used Canare L-2T2S)

2. Shrink Wrap or Electrical Tape 

3. 3mm or 4mm Electret or 3mm MEMS microphone with a relatively flat and extended response. 

* see [capsule_testing](capsule_testing.md).

3. Male 3.5mm connector

4. 2 Part Epoxy or Thick Gel Super Glue
    
5. Apple dongle or equivalent
