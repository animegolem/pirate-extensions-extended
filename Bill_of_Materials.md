## Bill of Materials 

### Ear Plugs 

1. A reasonably competent 3D printer is required in order to create the mold. See [print-settings](https://github.com/HTangl/pirate-extensions-extended/blob/main/print-settings.md). 

2. A two part, kneadable silicone. This should be between shore 40-65a so it is soft enough to form a perfect seal but firm enough that it will not deform and vary placement. The original paper suggests 55A is ideal if possible.

* [I've successfully used the following (40a) but harder would be more ideal.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TGKS4KY)

* [Needs to be tested but likely better. (50a)](https://micromark.com/products/micro-mark-rtv-silicone-mold-putty-50-hard)

3. Monofilament fishing line, .4mm or greater.

4. Super Glue

5. A needle or similar to make holes in the finished plug

6. Blade/Scalpel to clean up demolded plug. 
 
### Microphone

1. 3-10ft Well shielded Microphone cable (I used Canare L-4E5C)

2. 3mm Electret or MEMS microphone with a relatively flat and extended response. 

* see [capsule_testing](capsule_testing.md).

3. Male 3.5mm connector

4. Glue (Paper advises 2 part epoxy but i hate it so want to try stuff.)
  
* Currently having better luck with simple gel superglue. 

5. Apple dongle or equivalent
