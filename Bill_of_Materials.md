## Bill of Materials 

### Ear Plugs 

1. A reasonably competent 3D printer is required in order to create the mold. See [print-settings](https://github.com/HTangl/pirate-extensions-extended/blob/main/print-settings.md). 

2. A two part, kneadable silicone. This should be between shore 40-65a so it is soft enough to form a perfect seal but firm enough that it will not deform and vary placement. The original paper suggests 55A is ideal if possible. 

* see [capsule_testing.md](capsule_testing.md).

3. Monofilament fishing line, .4mm or greater.

4. Super Glue

5. A needle or similar to make holes in the finished plug

6. Blade/Scalpel to clean up demolded plug. 
 
### Microphone

1. 3-10ft Well shielded Microphone cable (I used Canare L-4E5C)

2. 3mm Electret or MEMS microphone with a relatively flat and extended response. 

* We have seen positive results with the [BeStar HBO0302C-58/1248](https://www.bestartech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/HBO0302C-58_1248-BTI.pdf) 

* The [CMC-3015-44L100](https://www.sameskydevices.com/product/resource/cmc-3015-44l100.pdf) had very poor SNR and was highly non-linear below 100hz. 

3. Male 3.5mm connector

4. Glue (Paper advises 2 part epoxy but i hate it so want to try stuff.) 

5. Apple dongle or equivalent
